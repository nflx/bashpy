## Requirements
Exact requirements TBD, but essentially:
- build-essentials
- python dev (tested with: python 3.8.0 from pyenv)
- bash sourcecode (tested with: bash 4.3 from github)
- editing of some hardcoded paths in Makefile

# Things I do
./getbashsrc.sh
PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared" pyenv install 3.8.0
# make sure you have pyenv installed/cloned to ~/.pyenv (or symlink it there or change paths in Makefile)
make -C pybash
make -C pybash test
