## Description
Bash loadable module that embeds python as builtin command pybash,
taking python code as first argument.

## Requirements
see ../INSTALL

## Based on 
- The Embedding Python example here:
  https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html#very-high-level-embedding

- Bash examples/loadables/cat.c
https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/master/examples/loadables/cat.c

## Why
Because it could be done. And I wanted to try building a loadable module after I got notion about the loadable module support in Bash by this video about Suidbash https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGtxJ8opa8.

There already exist loadable modules for other languages as luabash and perlbash. As I found out after some research, but I could not find any available python project.
