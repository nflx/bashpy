# Description
Bash loadable module that embeds python as builtin command bashpy,
taking python code as first argument.

# State
It's not very useful but just as the perl equivalent merely a proof of concept.
It does not provide the python context any access to bash internals or even support passing it variables.

# Based on
- The Embedding Python example here:
  https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html#very-high-level-embedding

- Bash examples/loadables/cat.c
  https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/master/examples/loadables/cat.c

# Why
I wanted to try building a loadable module after I got notion about the loadable module support in Bash by this video about Suidbash https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGtxJ8opa8.

There already exist loadable modules for other languages as:
- luabash [https://github.com/alfredopalhares/LuaBash]
- perl [https://github.com/bminor/bash/tree/master/examples/loadables/perl].

As I found out after some research, but I could not find any python equivalent.

# Install
## Requirements
Exact requirements TBD, but essentially:
- build-essentials
- python dev (tested with: python 3.8.0 from pyenv)
- bash sourcecode (tested with: bash 4.3 from github)
- editing of some hardcoded paths in Makefile

## Things I do to make it run
The `getbashsrc.sh` script downloads and configures bash 5.0, update it first to match the bash --version.
```
./getbashsrc.sh
```

Python needs to be built with `--enable-shared`, this is how do that using pyenv.
```
PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared" pyenv install 3.8.0
```

Make sure you have pyenv installed/cloned to ~/.pyenv (or symlink it there or change paths in Makefile).
```
make -C bashpy
make -C bashpy test
```

## Examples
See `examples/*.sh` for some info on how to invoke bashpy from a script.

## Troubleshoot
Build and test bash loadable `examples/loadables/hello` (a "hello world" example).
```
### build
./configure
make pathnames.h
make -C examples/loadables hello

### enable
cd examples/loadables
enable -f $PWD/hello hello

### run
hello
Hello world

### unload
enable -d $PWD/hello hello
hello
<error>
```

## Future ideas
- Support passing variables somehow.
- Support stdin (see `bash/examples/loadable/cat.c`).
- Pass the python code as file.
- Make it easier to write code inline compared to examples.
